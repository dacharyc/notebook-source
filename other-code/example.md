# Example

This is a placeholder to represent what it might look like to have other
code alongside of the notebooks directory. Updates to these files outside
of the `notebooks` directory do not get copied to the [notebook-copy](https://github.com/dacharyc/notebook-copy)
repository. They could have their own GitHub workflows to perform independent
tasks.
